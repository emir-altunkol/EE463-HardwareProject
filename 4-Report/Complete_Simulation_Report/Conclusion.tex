\section{Conclusion} \label{conclude}

In this report, the first analysis of the selected design for the DC-motor drive, is performed. For the achievement of 4 quadrant operation and ease of control, full-bridge diode rectifier and H-bridge is selected as the design topology. The selected design is compared with other possible topologies for the task based on its advantages and theoretical performances. Simulation of the individual modules are done with some of the non-idealities being present in the simulations. According to the simulation results, rated voltage and current values for different modes of operations, are detected for the components to be implemented in real life application. Appropriate and commercially available diodes, MOSFETs and capacitors are selected for the implementation step of the project.

In the next steps of the project, the most suitable and commercially available ones from the selected models (also new models found recently in the further market research), will be bought. After checking the detailed simulation of these models (including non-idealities of the models to the simulation as much as possible), the implementation phase will start and considering the project specifications, design deliverables and test requirements, design will be modified until the end of the implementation phase of the project.
